# Overview of Christian Kraft's Projects

This README outlines an overview of my projects throughout the past few years. 

I plan to use this repository's EmberJS application, which is a continuation of my resume-builder project, to display this information (which will be served at christiankraft.com).

## Scope

I have included projects that are recent, relevant, and sufficiently complete (as well as those that I am currently on). On the other hand, I have excluded projects that I feel are not indicative of my current interest and skills.

## Software Projects

### Relay Music Player

[Link to Repo](https://github.com/theckraft/RelayMusicPlayer)

As a proof-of-concept project and exercise in design patterns, I built a music service API adapter for the iOS music player. Specifically, I designed adapters for the Spotify and Apple Music APIs with the intention to develop a universal music player—one that can create a music queue from multiple streaming services.

### Resume Builder

[link to Repo](https://github.com/theckraft/resume-builder)

This EmberJS web application was my submission to an assignment for a graduate User Interfaces course. It simply allowed users to input and share their resume information.

### Senior Design - Fora, "The Platform for Discussion"

For my senior design project, my team and I engineered a web application that allowed professors to prepare discussion assignments for their students. The NodeJS frontend application (which interfaced AWS Lambda) elicited availability from the participating students and accordingly prepared a WebRTC voice discussion.

My team competed as a finalist in Drexel's 2018-2019 Computing and Informatics Senior Design Competition.

### March Madness Predictions

For the past few years, a couple friends and I have participated in March Madness competitions using a classification program (that we built using the scikit-learn Python library).

### Misc.

During the past couple of months, I have automated a piece of my mom's job. Specifically, I developed a Python program that reads and manipulates Excel data according to txt configuration files.

## Research/Documentation Projects

### Peer Grading Review and Practical Implementation

[Posted on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6622862146952847360/)

As part of my CS graduate curriculum, I conducted an independent study on Peer Grading Mechanism Design. I was specifically interested in how a discussion platform (see Fora above—software that would facilitate a discussion between a group of people) could elicit truthful assessments from discussion members (with regards to the other members' "performances"). Although I only earned 3 credit hours for this study, I spent about 9 credit hours worth of time developing this extensive review of peer grading mechanisms and their practical implementation.

Abstract: The educational assessment method of peer grading offers various new opportunities for web-based ed- ucational platforms. Peer grading systems attempt to facilitate learning and generate legitimate grades when access to experts is limited. We study existing peer grading systems for assessment attributes and mech- anisms that increase peer grading effectiveness. We consider how web-based platforms may incorporate peer grading by describing practical implementation opportunities for an example discussion platform.

### Requirements Guide

Since I intend to engineer software throughout my career, I embarked on a project to aggregate best practices for requirements engineering and construct a comprehensive guide.
